deeplearngene Analysis
======================

Provided here are two IPython notebooks that represent initial efforts to summarize and visualize the results of evolution of news article classifier models.

[The first notebook plots histograms](LINK) of model accuracies. Its output is shown on the main README file of this repo.

[The second notebook plots heatmaps](LINK) from two models from the last round of evolution in [demo2](LINK). These heatmaps foreshadow future value in extending fitness functions beyond simply classification accuracy. Utilizing different metrics (e.g., f1 statistic, AUC), and uncovering the particular biases of each model can lead to improved fitness functions that select diverse parent models with mutually complementary features.
